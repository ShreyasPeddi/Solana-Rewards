# Solana Rewards
1st Place, Solana General Track + 3rd Place Overall, OlympicHacks 2023

OlympiHacks is Canada's biggest chain-agnostic hackathon. We use Google Rewards when we are free to earn some money and buy tools, characters and paid apps from PlayStore. We were inspired by this and want to bring it to web3! So we present Solana Rewards, which is a web app made entirely on the Solana blockchain. As a user, you can fill out 2-5 minute surveys and earn free NFTs and tokens through airdrops. Our use cases include helping researchers fill questionnaires with data from real users, helping startups get feedback on products, or helping event management companies get customer reviews.

We built our logic for the smart contract as well as minting and airdroping NFTs with Solana. We used Metaplex, specifically candy machine and sugar for minting NFTs. Our frontend is both next.js (for the NFT aidrops) and react with surveyjs (for filling surveys).
